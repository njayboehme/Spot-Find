# Capstone Team 26: Spot & Find
The required folder/files that are needed to run this project are all located in Box->Team 26->Artifacts->Software->Code. This repo is provided as a reference if there are problems in coming years with the code in Box. In case you don't have our Box information yet the required folders are: heatmap_visualization, lora_gps_integration, RSSI_poll, UI, and esp32-heat-map. In the esp32-heat-map all you really need is the passive folder and the _components folder. To begin this project, read the setup documents (SU-001 -> 003) in Software (in Box) and follow them carefully. To test you did all of the setup correctly, follow FT-001.
